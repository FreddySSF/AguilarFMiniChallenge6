The program will prompt the user to enter a number and it will output
whether the number is odd or even. Add data validation and replay option.

Peer Reviewed By: Andrea Burr - i really like it, a lot of code projects including my one cant take commas in mubers so if you write 3,000 it errors and says in valid but with of woith ut it read as a number and i really liked that touch to it. i love he made it like a game show too i think that makes it really an extra step into the code and i really like that
